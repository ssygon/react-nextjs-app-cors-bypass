This is a simple SPA using React+Nextjs to bypass CORS using server-side fetch() requests and test:

1. if a URL exists
2. if can fetch posts data from the third-party API https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts


## Getting Started

First in the terminal run to install package:
```bash
npm i
```

Now open another terminal tab and run the development server to start the SPA:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.
